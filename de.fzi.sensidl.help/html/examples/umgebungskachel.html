	<h1>Umgebungskachel Example</h1>
	
	<p>
		The Umgebungskachel Example shows how SensIDL could be used in an SmartHome Environment. It describes the communication
		between a Home Automation Gateway (such as the QIVICON Home Base) and a Sensor that continuously collects data and communicates with the 
		SmartHome Gateway.
	</p>
	<p>
		A communication described as above can be found in the SensIDL <a href="https://github.com/SENSIDL-PROJECT/SensIDL/tree/master/code/demonstration">demonstration repository</a>.
		It features some sensors (such as temperature or brightness) with a REST-Service running on an Intel Galileo developer board and a SmartHome binding for the Qivicon Home Base.
