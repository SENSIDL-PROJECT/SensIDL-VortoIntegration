	<h1>SensIDL Generation Wizard</h1>

	<h3>Model</h3>
	<p>The Model text field is the path to your *.sidl file from which
		the code should be generated. The Path will be specified
		automatically, depending on which file the user clicked to start the
		Wizard, but can also be modified manually by the user.</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Path</h3>
	<p>The Path text field is the path to the directory in which the
		files will be generated. It should be specified by the User.</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Generation Language</h3>
	<p>The ComboBox at the bottom specifies the languages in which the
		files will be generated. The user can pick one of the possible
		options.</p>
	<p><b>Note</b>: The option <code>All</code> will not generate the Java Plug-in Project. 
		Further information about the Java Plug-in Project generation is provided below </p>
		
	<h4> Java Plug-in Project Generation </h4>
	<p>To not only generate plain Java files but also generate a whole 
		Java Plugin-in Project select the <code>Java Plug-in Project</code> option from the 
		language drop down menu. Generating a Java Plug-in Project has some small 
		differences from generating only files. <br>
		The Plug-in Project only can be generated at the root of the current 
		workspace. Because of this the <code>Path</code> has to be in a 
		specific pattern: It has to start with <code>platform:/resource/</code> 
		followed by the name of the Plug-in Project to generate (the name can't 
		include <code>'/'</code>).<br>
		Furthermore your IDE has to contain the gson plug-in  provided by google. 
		This should be the case if you are using Eclipse Mars or above. If your
		IDE does not contain the gson plug-in, you can download the newest version 
		from the <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">github repository</a>. 
		Download the .jar file and put it in your eclipse's plug-in folder 
		(<code>plugins</code>).</p> 
	<br>
	
	<h3>Workspace and File System</h3>

	<p>The Workspace Button opens up a dialog to specify a file or the
		directory in the Workspace. The File System Button opens up a dialog
		to specify a file or a directory in the file system of the computer.</p>
