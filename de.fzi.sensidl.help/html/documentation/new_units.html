	<h1>Add new Units to SensIDL</h1>

	<p>
		The Units System of SensIDL is based on <a href="http://jscience.org/">JScience</a>
		and therefore contains many Units, probably all the user will ever
		need. Nevertheless there is the Option to define new Units. To do so,
		the user has to make changes in the Source Code.
	</p>
	<p>
		First locate the <code>NonSILabels.java</code> Java-File. To find the class
		open the <code>de.fzi.sensidl.desgin</code> Project and go into the <code>src-man</code>
		Folder. The class is then contained in the <code>de.fzi.sensidl.design.util</code>
		package. Locate the <code>public static void init()</code> Method.
	</p>

	<p>
		To declare a new unit you can orientate yourself at the already
		declared units. Other examples are the following as given as in the
		JScience Documentation: <code>
			UnitFormat.getInstance().label(DAY.multiply(365), "year");<br>
			UnitFormat.getInstance().label(METER.multiply(0.3048), "ft");
		</code>
